# Flipper BioAmp EXG Pill Bio Signal Acquisition

This application allows control of the BioAmp EXG Pill. This Analog Front End (AFE) board produces publication grade BioPotential signals like ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG.
This goal of this project is to collect and share bio signals and eventually work on a flipper BCI.
